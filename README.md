<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


Fallacies was an event where players scavenge for clues through mysterious instagram profiles and reach on a final answer. The players analyse the posts and stories on the account and enters the final answer on the platform made for the same. This project is the backend for the same platform. We make the user login or signup and the user is then redirected to the answer submissions page where they have to input answer. The server returns the next account if the answer entered by the user is correct otherwise an appropriate error message is returned.
